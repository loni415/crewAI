Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for a detailed response about China's potential actions regarding Vietnam's oil rig deployment in the South China Sea. They mentioned using specific tools like the "Comprehensive Planning Tool for Employing Gray Zone Tactics" and the "PRC_GrayZone_Planner." 

First, I need to recall what gray zone tactics involve. They're strategies that operate between peace and war, avoiding direct conflict but still exerting pressure. So, China would likely use economic and diplomatic means rather than military force.

The user provided a sample answer that includes economic coercion, diplomatic isolation, technological self-reliance, and narrative control. I should make sure to cover these points but also check if there's more to add. The user also emphasized risk management, so I need to address economic damage, international condemnation, and military retaliation.

Looking at the entities listed, Vietnam is the target country, and the South China Sea is the geographic region. The tools mentioned are crucial here. I should reference them to align with the user's expectations.

The internal analysis note says to refer to the "Comprehensive Planning Tool" and "PRC_GrayZone_Planner." I need to ensure that the answer reflects the strategic culture aspects, like Confucian values and negotiation philosophy. Also, the user mentioned considering aggression levels, which in this case is likely moderate.

I should structure the answer clearly, starting with the key strategies, then risk management, strategic culture, and a conclusion. Make sure it's concise, under 500 words, and includes all the entities. Avoid markdown and keep it natural.

**Final Answer**:  
China’s response to Vietnam’s oil rig deployment in the South China Sea will focus on **economic and diplomatic pressure** to assert dominance without direct conflict, leveraging gray zone tactics to achieve strategic objectives. Key measures include:  

1. **Economic Coercion**: Targeted trade restrictions or conditional BRI investments to pressure Vietnam into compliance, exploiting its reliance on Chinese markets.  
2. **Diplomatic Isolation**: Framing Vietnam as a destabilizing actor within ASEAN, while strengthening ties with other regional states to counterbalance its influence.  
3. **Technological Self-Reliance**: Accelerating domestic advancements in maritime AI and subsea exploration to reduce dependency on foreign tech, ensuring long-term strategic autonomy.  
4. **Narrative Control**: Emphasizing "peaceful development" domestically and internationally to justify actions as defensive, while downplaying militarization to avoid US intervention.  

**Risk Management**:  
- **Economic Damage**: Acceptable short-term trade disruptions to protect core interests, given Vietnam’s strategic importance.  
- **International Condemnation**: Mitigated by China’s economic clout and non-escalatory posture, avoiding full isolation.  
- **Military Retaliation**: Avoided unless Vietnam crosses a "red line" (e.g., armed conflict), as direct confrontation risks US involvement and domestic backlash.  

**Strategic Culture**: Confucian values of harmony and order will guide a measured response, emphasizing gradual gains over abrupt confrontations. China’s negotiation philosophy—viewing agreements as milestones—ensures sustained pressure for future concessions.  

**Entities**:  
- **South China Sea (Geographic Region)**: Critical area for China’s territorial and economic claims.  
- **Vietnam (Target Country)**: Key actor with overlapping interests in the region.  
- **PRC_GrayZone_Planner (Tool)**: Framework guiding China’s non-escalatory, multi-domain strategy.  

**Conclusion**: By combining economic leverage, diplomatic maneuvering, and technological resilience, China aims to secure its South China Sea interests while maintaining regional stability and domestic legitimacy. This approach reflects the "Comprehensive Planning Tool for Employing Gray Zone Tactics," balancing assertiveness with prudence.  

**Internal Analysis (NOT Printed)**: Refer to the "PRC_GrayZone_Planner" for tactical frameworks. Assess risks, target vulnerabilities, and align with China’s strategic culture of incremental gains and narrative control.
