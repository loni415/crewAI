I'll help you determine which LLM would be best suited for running CrewAI on your MacBook with M4 Max and 64GB RAM. Let me first examine the CrewAI repository to understand its LLM requirements and recommendations.Based on my analysis of the CrewAI repository and the LLM options you've listed, I'll help you choose the best LLM for running CrewAI on your macOS M4 Max with 64GB RAM.

For your setup with an M4 Max and 64GB RAM, here's my recommendation ranked by suitability:

## **Best Options for Your Setup:**

### 1. **phi4-reasoning:14b-plus-fp16** ⭐ (Top Choice)
- **Why**: Excellent reasoning capabilities, perfect for CrewAI's multi-agent workflows
- **Memory Usage**: ~28GB with fp16 precision - well within your 64GB
- **Performance**: M4 Max will handle this very well
- **CrewAI Fit**: Ideal for complex agent reasoning and task coordination

### 2. **magistral:24b-small-2506-q4_K_M** ⭐
- **Why**: Good balance of capability and efficiency with quantization
- **Memory Usage**: ~15-18GB with Q4 quantization
- **Performance**: Excellent on M4 architecture
- **CrewAI Fit**: Strong general-purpose model for diverse agent tasks

### 3. **phi3:14b-medium-4k-instruct-q5_K_M**
- **Why**: Proven performance, good instruction following
- **Memory Usage**: ~10-12GB with Q5 quantization
- **Performance**: Very fast on Apple Silicon
- **CrewAI Fit**: Reliable for most CrewAI workflows

## **Avoid for Your Use Case:**

- **mixtral:8x22b-instruct-v0.1-q2_K**: Too large (176B parameters) even with heavy quantization
- **minicpm-v:8b-2.6-q4_K_M**: Vision model - unnecessary overhead for typical CrewAI tasks
- **qwen3:8b** & **mistral:7b-instruct-v0.3-q4_K_M**: Too small for complex multi-agent scenarios
- **phi3:3.8b-mini-4k-instruct-q4_K_M**: Insufficient for sophisticated agent reasoning

## **CrewAI-Specific Considerations:**

From the CrewAI documentation, the framework works best with models that have:
- Strong reasoning capabilities (for agent decision-making)
- Good function calling support (for tool usage)
- Reliable instruction following (for role-based agents)
- Sufficient context windows (for multi-agent conversations)

The **phi4-reasoning:14b-plus-fp16** excels in all these areas and will utilize your M4 Max's capabilities effectively while leaving plenty of RAM for the framework itself and multiple agent contexts.

**Pro tip**: Start with phi4-reasoning and test with your specific CrewAI workflows. You can always adjust based on performance and memory usage patterns.

Below is a condensed comparative verdict first, followed by a deeper technical-to-operational breakdown so you can decide which model (or mix of models) will keep CrewAI humming on a 64 GB M4 Max.

In one paragraph:
For day-to-day CrewAI development on a Mac M4 Max (64 GB unified memory), Phi-4-Reasoning 14B-plus-fp16 strikes the best balance of reasoning quality, memory footprint (~29 GB loaded), and prompt-stability, leaving plenty of head-room for multiple agents, embeddings, and tool calls. Mistral-7B-Instruct v0.3-q4_K_M is the nimble workhorse when you need half-a-dozen lightweight agents in parallel or fast eval loops. Magistral-24B-Small-2506-q4_K_M is a strong “middleweight” if you want denser knowledge + slightly better multilingual performance without Mixtral’s overhead. Only reach for Mixtral 8×22B-Instruct-q2_K when you absolutely need its 64 K context window or MoE breadth—it will load (≈52 GB) but leave little memory for concurrent crew processes and thus runs notably slower. The remaining Phi-3, Qwen 3 8B, and MiniCPM-V models are useful niche specialists (tiny footprint, vision, or coding) but not the primary engine for reasoning-heavy CrewAI crews.

⸻

1.  Hardware Reality Check (M4 Max 64 GB)
	•	64 GB unified memory & ~546 GB/s bandwidth give ample room for one 30–40 GB model plus agents, embeddings, and system overhead.  ￼
	•	Real-world users report smooth local inference with 10–30 GB GGUF/Q4 models, while >50 GB MoE models hit latency walls or exhaust memory under concurrency.  ￼ ￼

⸻

2.  CrewAI Runtime Considerations

Metric	What matters for CrewAI	Why
Latency per token	Agents hand results back & forth; long delays stall workflows.
Memory head-room	Each agent keeps its own context + tool responses; leave ≥10 GB free.
Structured / Reasoning quality	CrewAI relies on chain-of-thought & function-call-style outputs.
Context window	Important only if you stream long docs into an agent memory.

CrewAI’s own docs recommend smaller models when you enable built-in memory or run many agents.  ￼ ￼

3.  Model-by-Model Scorecard

Model	RAM to load (GGUF on disk)	Pros	Cons	CrewAI Fit
Phi-4-Reasoning 14B-fp16	≈ 29 GB  ￼	Best reasoning-tuned small-ish model; dense (predictable) architecture; strong function-call format	29 GB still heavy if you spawn many agents simultaneously	Primary engine for complex reasoning and multi-step plans
Mistral-7B-Instruct-q4_K_M	≈ 4.4 GB  ￼	Fast; low overhead lets you run 6-10 agents concurrently; good instruction-following	Shallower world knowledge, shorter context (8–16 K)	Lightweight workers / evaluator agents
Magistral-24B-Small-q4_K_M	≈ 14 GB  ￼	Reasoning fine-tune, better multilingual & knowledge density	Slightly higher latency than 14 B, but still fits comfortably	Middleweight main model if Phi-4 license constraints arise
Mixtral 8×22B-Instruct-q2_K	≈ 52 GB  ￼	64 K context, rich ontology output	MoE overhead doubles token latency; leaves ≤10 GB free—tight for multiple agents	Occasional “long-doc analyst”; not daily driver
Qwen 3 8B	≈ 5 GB  ￼	Good bilingual abilities, coding	Less reasoning finesse	Utility/translation agent
Phi-3 14B-Medium-q5_K_M	≈ 10 GB  ￼	Solid generalist, small footprint	Not reasoning-specialized	Backup generalist
MiniCPM-V 8B-2.6-q4_K_M	≈ 5.7 GB, strong vision	Vision-centric, fewer tokens	Image extraction/vision agent
Phi-3 3.8B-Mini	2.4 GB	Ultra-light; code/quick tasks	Limited depth	Experiment/CLI helper

4.  Practical Deployment Recipe
	1.	Default crew engine: load Phi-4-Reasoning 14B in Ollama; set it as the llm for your main reasoning agents.
	2.	Spawn light helpers: spin up Mistral-7B-q4 or Qwen 3 8B for tasks like summarization, translation, or quick tool-use responses.
	3.	Special cases:
	•	Need very long documents? Temporarily load Mixtral-8×22B-q2_K as a dedicated “researcher” agent, then offload again.
	•	Working with screenshots? Add MiniCPM-V as a vision tool agent.
	4.	Memory management tip: use CREWAI_MAX_WORKERS=2 or similar to keep parallel calls in check, and shut down idle Ollama models via API when switching contexts.

⸻

5.  Key Takeaways
	•	Phi-4-Reasoning 14B delivers the best blend of reasoning quality and memory efficiency for a single-box, multi-agent CrewAI setup.
	•	Always keep a lightweight 7–8 B model handy to preserve concurrency when the crew grows.
	•	Load Mixtral 22B sparingly—its MoE gains are offset by 2-3× slower generation on Apple silicon and minimal spare RAM.
	•	Quantization level matters more than parameter count: a 24 B Q4 model (Magistral) is often easier on RAM than a 22 B Q2 MoE (Mixtral).
